# Polynomial-regression

# diamters of pizzas vs prices of pizzas

#The idea is to think of a relationship  and use Polynomial regression to train, predict, and plot your results

: Polynomial regression is a special case of multiple linear regression that adds terms with degrees  greater than one to the model.
# The explanatory variable has been transformed and added as a third term to the model to captre the curvilinear relationship.
# If you execute the code, you will see that the simple linear regression model is plotted witha solid line. 
#The quadratic regression model is plotted with a dashed line and evidently the quadratic regression model fits the training data better.
